    The swift evolution of digital technologies in maritime operations has
    highlighted the critical need for tailored cybersecurity measures,
    especially to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
    targeting essential communication protocols such as NMEA 2000. This study
    introduces an innovative solution based on stochastic semi-Markov processes,
    specifically tailored to strengthen the cybersecurity framework of maritime
    IoT systems. By capturing and analyzing the distinct state transitions
    within maritime networks, the proposed model effectively identifies abnormal
    activities and promptly alerts operators to potential DDoS attacks, ensuring
    robust and uninterrupted maritime communications. Comprehensive simulations
    demonstrate the model’s superior accuracy, high detection efficiency, and
    minimal error rates, establishing it as a dependable and specialized
    approach to protecting critical maritime systems. This research
    significantly advances maritime cybersecurity by offering proactive and
    adaptive mechanisms to combat increasingly complex cyber threats.

    The maritime sector is facing a continuous shift towards digitalization. A
    ship built during the last decade shows all characteristics of a
    comprehensive information system, combining information and operational
    technologies. While industrial programmable logic controllers are used for
    engine and power management, the bridge is now highly relying on digital
    sensors, networks and displays for navigation. Meanwhile, over the last few
    years, many cyber attacks targeting maritime assets and made publicly conﬁrm
    a real interest of criminal and non-state actors in this critical sector for
    our globalized economies. In this work, a concept designed to detect and
    visualize advanced navigation cyber attacks on maritime systems using
    contextual NMEA data analytics is presented. A strategy is built to enhance
    the detection of navigation spooﬁng attacks, assess possible physical
    impacts onboard and support decision makers.

    The implementation of cybersecurity standards and directives in the maritime
    sector plays a crucial role in protecting critical maritime infrastructures
    from cyber threats. The level of protection depends heavily on humans.
    However, the effectiveness of cybersecurity training and compliance
    programmes, an essential component of these standards, is often hindered by
    challenges related to the sector’s environment, including the established
    technologies, practices, and norms. This paper aims to identify these
    challenges through a literature review and set the basis for more effective
    human risk minimization, responses, and training. We identify 17 challenges
    and validate them with an online survey (N = 205) capturing real-world
    perspectives from maritime-related stakeholders. Our findings contribute to
    enhancing the effectiveness of maritime cybersecurity training and
    compliance programmes, ultimately strengthening the maritime cybersecurity
    posture.

    The maritime transportation sector is undergoing a profound shift with the
    emergence of autonomous vessels powered by real-time artificial intelligence
    (AI) agents. This article investigates the pivotal role of these agents in
    enhancing the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of autonomous maritime
    systems. Following a structured literature review, we examine the
    architecture of real-time AI agents, including sensor integration,
    communication systems, and computational infrastructure. We distinguish
    maritime AI agents from conventional systems by emphasizing their
    specialized functions, real-time processing demands, and resilience in
    dynamic environments. Key safety mechanisms—such as collision avoidance,
    anomaly detection, emergency coordination, and fail-safe operations—are
    analyzed to demonstrate how AI agents contribute to operational reliability.
    The study also explores regulatory compliance, focusing on emission control,
    real-time monitoring, and data governance. Implementation challenges,
    including limited onboard computational power, legal and ethical
    constraints, and interoperability issues, are addressed with practical
    solutions such as edge AI and modular architectures. Finally, the article
    outlines future research directions involving smart port integration,
    scalable AI models, and emerging technologies like federated and explainable
    AI. This work highlights the transformative potential of AI agents in
    advancing autonomous maritime transportation.

    We present a novel method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using
    topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies,
    commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data. This approach is the
    first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding
    $2+1$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into $\mathbb{R}^3$, we utilize
    persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in
    $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions,
    trajectory data embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over time do not form loops.
    Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the
    presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable
    of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in
    geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our
    approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering
    enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in
    geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various
    applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and
    surveillance.

    This article considers the current technological developments in uncrewed
    Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), examines the legal and regulatory
    challenges that they raise, and describes the ways in which an international
    body (the International Maritime Organization, IMO) and a national agency
    (UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency, MCA) are engaging with the massive task
    of regulating this new development in shipping. To achieve the research aim,
    the article combines primary data from interviews with industry, government
    and international regulators, a survey completed by practitioners, experts
    and academics working in the field, and relevant secondary sources. The
    article makes an original contribution by noting and analysing the
    approaches of the IMO and the UK government – bodies which are highly
    influential in shaping global attitudes, preparation, adoption and responses
    to such innovative technologies like MASS – and how they have engaged with
    the difficult question of regulating the various legal, technical and
    cybersecurity challenges that they raise. It concludes that for the MASS
    technology to fulfil its potential and gradually see the integration of such
    vessels in international shipping in a safe, secure and sustainable way, the
    international community needs to work together, and update by consensus the
    key legal instruments and policy documents. In this major task, the UK
    approach and IOM’s leading role can play a protagonist role in developing
    best practice and implementing respectively.

    internationales durant l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie.

    Ces navires, généralement vieux et mal assurés, sont principalement
    enregistrés sous des pavillons de complaisance.

    Cette flotte a été développée pour contourner les restrictions imposées par
    les sanctions économiques et permettre à la Russie de continuer à financer
    sa guerre en Ukraine. Environ 70 % du pétrole russe exporté par voie
    maritime l'est à bord de ces navires.

    Marine radar systems are essential for maritime safety but are increasingly
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This research presents a method to improve
    marine radar security using semi-supervised learning with a Self-Training
    Classifier. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, this approach
    enhances the detection of cyber threats. The RadarPWN dataset, consisting of
    network traffic from marine radar systems, was preprocessed and used to
    train a RandomForestClassifier (RFC). Through iterative training,
    high-confidence predictions from unlabeled data were incorporated to improve
    detection accuracy. The method achieved 99.99% accuracy, effectively
    identifying multiple attack types, including scaling, addition, rotation,
    move, translation, removal, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This
    approach strengthens the resilience of marine radar systems, addressing the
    challenge of limited labeled data in maritime cybersecurity.

  abstract: "The escalating complexity of maritime operations and the integration of advanced radar systems have heightened the susceptibility of maritime infrastructures to sophisticated cyber intrusions. Ensuring resilient and privacy-preserving intrusion detection in such environments necessitates innovative solutions capable of learning from distributed, heterogeneous data sources without compromising sensitive information. This study introduces FED-GEM-CN, a novel federated learning framework designed explicitly for maritime radar intrusion detection. The proposed architecture integrates dual parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) pipelines to independently process network and radar modality features, which are subsequently fused via a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to capture intricate inter-modal dependencies. To enhance feature discriminability, a supervised contrastive learning paradigm is incorporated, while a gradient episodic memory (GEM) buffer strategically retains challenging instances to bolster model robustness against hard-to-detect intrusions. Operating under a federated learning scheme, FED-GEM-CN facilitates collaborative model optimization across distributed radar nodes, preserving data locality and mitigating privacy risks inherent in centralized approaches. Experimental evaluations conducted on a comprehensive real-world maritime radar dataset reveal that FED-GEM-CN achieves superior performance, attaining an overall accuracy exceeding 99\_% and macro F1-scores above 0.97 across federated rounds, with convergence typically observed within 15 communication iterations. These findings substantiate the efficacy of the proposed system in delivering robust, energy-efficient, and privacy-aware intrusion detection tailored to the constraints of maritime radar networks. The approach underscores a significant advancement toward deploying intelligent, distributed cybersecurity solutions within critical maritime infrastructures."

    Space tracking ships are critical assets in modern space exploration,
    overcoming the limitations of land-based tracking systems by providing
    real-time telemetry, trajectory monitoring, and communication support for
    satellites and spacecraft. However, the existing literature offers limited
    insights into the historical development, technological evolution, and
    collaborative research trends of these specialized vessels. This study
    employs a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace (6.3.R1) to identify
    research trends, highlight key technological advancements, and assess
    international collaboration. By analyzing publications from major
    contributors, including the United States, the former Soviet Union, France,
    and China, the paper reveals technological innovations such as advancements
    in measurement systems, communication technologies, and the integration of
    artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced tracking precision. Structural and
    operational analyses emphasize the importance of design factors, including
    ship dimensions and internal systems, for ensuring optimal performance in
    challenging maritime environments. The findings highlight evolving
    technological priorities and persistent gaps in international collaboration,
    suggesting opportunities for global partnerships to advance the field. This
    study bridges historical and technical gaps, providing valuable insights for
    enhancing the efficiency and strategic relevance of space tracking ships in
    future space exploration missions.

    The challenging climate conditions in the Arctic Ocean make Search and
    Rescue (SAR) operations particularly difficult. An emerging risk that
    demands attention in this context is cybersecurity. The paper examines
    cybersecurity threats by focusing on the perspective of Arctic SAR
    operations. A ship may require assistance due to cyberattacks compromising
    its IT networks or navigation equipment. Attacks could occur through random
    incidents or intentional actions by cyber criminals who can target
    vulnerable ships from public databases. The research explores how
    cyber-attacks could compromise SAR operations, providing detailed threat
    scenarios by implementing the STAP safe-sec methodology and utilising
    experts from Arctic rescue operations. The paper highlights areas that need
    Ships in the Arctic Ocean to be cyber-attack resilient. Cybercriminals could
    use several pieces of information from public domains to select one or
    multiple targets when rescue operations would be particularly challenging.
    The information includes ship equipment failures, wind force, sea state, the
    number of crew and passengers in distress, and the proximity of nearby
    ships. A practical scenario demonstrates the methodology's application,
    focusing on bulk carriers with Polar Code certification. This scenario
    utilises historical data on weather conditions and ship traffic along the
    North Sea Route to highlight the practical implications of the research
    findings.

    Objective: To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by
    software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing
    SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process.

    Method: We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of
    undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve
    the SR process. Studies were classiﬁed with respect to the stage in the SR
    process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced
    by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools.

    Results: We identiﬁed 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE
    conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common
    criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries
    are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the
    quality of empirical studies of different types is difﬁcult.

    Conclusion: We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to
    construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard
    based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings
    and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to
    be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction
    but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would beneﬁt from
    tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent
    validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical
    methods remains a major problem.

    The Maritime Transportation System (MTS) is the foundation of global trade,
    a crucial pillar of our economy’s supply chains, but also critical to energy
    and food security. At the same time, it is increasingly exposed to new types
    of threats. These include attacks from the cyber and electromagnetic
    spectrum against various information and telecommunications systems on board
    vessels as the backbone of the MTS. The radio-based Automatic Identification
    System (AIS) is one of these systems, used to monitor ship routes and for
    traffic planning, and supports collision avoidance on the vessel side. The
    technical vulnerabilities of the system have long been known and caution is
    therefore advised. Conventional attacks are usually easy to recognize, so
    that disruptions to operations can occur, but serious damage can be limited.
    In this paper, however, we present a novel radio-based attack on AIS that
    enables to selectively suppress identification messages of individual ships
    and thus to manipulate the situational awareness on the vessel’s bridge in a
    stealthy manner, which can have catastrophic impacts in critical situations.
    We demonstrate the technical feasibility of this attack in a laboratory
    environment with real hardware and, by elaborating this vulnerability, we
    are contributing to increasing the resilience of the maritime domain against
    evolving hybrid threats.

    The enormous oceans of today are the worldwide arteries of commerce and
    transportation, making maritime security an issue of fundamental importance.
    The issue at stake is that conventional approaches of identifying and
    tracking ships at sea often fail to keep up with the ever-changing
    conditions of the ocean. These restrictions threaten international commerce,
    security, and ecological equilibrium by making countries more vulnerable to
    things like piracy, smuggling, illicit fishing, and pollution. Automatic
    Identification System (AIS) analytics are strengthened by a range of
    state-of-theart machine learning and deep learning algorithms in our
    "Next-Gen Maritime Security" solution. Through the use of these methods, we
    are able to improve vessel identification, trajectory prediction, behavior
    grouping, vessel type classification, and anomaly detection. By doing so, we
    are able to prevent potential threats to maritime security from occurring,
    therefore protecting international shipping lanes, maritime workers, and
    marine ecosystems. Our novel strategy provides a solid answer to the problem
    of marine security in today's dynamic environment.

    The maritime industry stands at a critical juncture, where the imperative
    for technological advancement intersects with the pressing need for robust
    cybersecurity measures. Maritime cybersecurity refers to the protection of
    computer systems and digital assests within the maritime industry, as well
    as the broader network of interconnected components that make up the
    maritime ecosystem. In this survey, we aim to identify the significant
    domains of maritime cybersecurity and measure their effectiveness. We have
    provided an in-depth analysis of threats in key maritime systems, including
    AIS, GNSS, ECDIS, VDR, RADAR, VSAT, and GMDSS, while exploring real-world
    cyber incidents that have impacted the sector. A multi-dimensional taxonomy
    of maritime cyber attacks is presented, offering insights into threat
    actors, motivations, and impacts. We have also evaluated various security
    solutions, from integrated solutions to component specific solutions.
    Finally, we have shared open challenges and future solutions. In the
    supplementary section, we have presented definitions and vulnerabilities of
    vessel components that have discussed in this survey. By addressing all
    these critical issues with key interconnected aspects, this review aims to
    foster a more resilient maritime ecosystem.

    This paper uses data processing techniques to reduce the required
    transmission bandwidth in ship-to-shore communications. The proposed
    framework (ONline Efficient Sources Transmission Optimizer - ONESTO)
    leverages state-ofthe-art technologies and novel algorithms to automatically
    optimize transmissions under structural (e.g., available bandwidth, fixed
    packet overhead) and user-defined (e.g., maximum latency) constraints. In
    addition, ONESTO authenticates and encrypts the communication between the
    ship and the shore via mainstream free and open-source software components.
    Initially, we present the abstract mathematical formulation of the problem,
    with its assumptions, goal function, constraints, and significant
    quantities. Then, we introduce the architecture of a system capable of
    continuously estimating the compressibility, processing and transmission
    time of streaming data. Such estimations allow ONESTO to calculate and apply
    optimal parameters for achieving the best compression ratio. Lastly, using a
    prototypical implementation, we evaluate the system performance with a Class
    B ship simulator on two realistic use cases. Our experiments show an
    excellent compression ratio with maritime protocols (more than 40:1) and a
    limited latency impact, demonstrating the approach’s viability.

    Automatic identification system is a navigation aid system that allows
    vessels to exchange automatically positions, identity and other information.
    It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it.
    However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to
    mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to
    detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the
    time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work,
    the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the
    system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message
    falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA
    protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship
    and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed
    strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being
    computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of
    the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry
    and academia in this field.

    The maritime industry is undergoing a digital transformation, integrating
    automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT)
    to enhance operational efficiency and safety. However, this technological
    evolution has also increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities, exposing
    vessels, ports, and maritime communication networks to sophisticated cyber
    threats. This systematic review, conducted following the PRISMA guidelines,
    examines the current landscape of AI-driven cybersecurity solutions in
    maritime environments. By analyzing peer-reviewed studies and industry
    reports, this review identifies key AI methodologies, including
    machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection
    mechanisms, predictive threat modeling, and AI-enhanced zero-trust
    architectures. This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques in
    mitigating cyber risks, explores their implementation challenges, and
    highlights existing research gaps. The findings indicate that AI-powered
    solutions significantly enhance real-time threat detection and response
    capabilities in maritime networks, yet issues such as data scarcity,
    regulatory constraints, and adversarial attacks on AI models remain
    unresolved. Future research directions should focus on integrating AI with
    blockchain, federated learning, and quantum cryptographic techniques to
    strengthen maritime cybersecurity frameworks.

  abstract: >-
    The Automatic Identification System (AIS), which provides real-time vessel
    information for collision avoidance and marine domain awareness, is vital to
    maritime navigation and safety. However, AIS is vulnerable to GPS spoofing
    attacks, where malicious actors transmit false GPS signals to mislead
    vessels about their location. These attacks pose significant risks to
    maritime safety and security. In this paper, a novel approach to detect
    spoofed points within vessel trajectory routes using AIS data is proposed.
    The methodology leverages the power of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
    (Bi-LSTM) networks, a deep learning architecture adept at capturing temporal
    dependencies in sequential data. By analysing AIS data streams, the proposed
    model identifies anomalies and deviations from expected patterns,
    effectively pinpointing instances of spoofing. Numerous tests using
    real-world AIS datasets were carried out, which showed that the suggested

    The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is vital for maritime safety and
    surveillance but it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as spoofing. In
    a previous work, a methodology was proposed for detecting falsified AIS data
    by analysing the stochastic properties of vessel trajectories, which
    achieved a classification accuracy of over 98% for standard spoofed
    datasets. However, in anticipation of future spoofing techniques, tests
    using injected noise in order to mimic the randomness of genuine AIS signals
    revealed that the initial method’s accuracy declined to nearly 50%. This
    study proposes an enhanced approach that addresses this limitation by
    training on datasets where Gaussian noise was added to spoofed vessel
    coordinates. The noise parameters were statistically derived from genuine
    maritime trajectories through parametric probability distribution fitting.
    This aspect allows the employed models to better capture the natural
    variability of authentic AIS signals. Additionally, unlike the previous
    offline approach, the improved methodology enables the real-time analysis of
    vessel tracks rather than relying solely on the post-processing of
    previously recorded vessel trajectories. To that, two of the proposed deep
    learning architectures, namely 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNNs)
    and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) maintained a detection accuracy of 99% even
    under noisy spoofing conditions, demonstrating a superior robustness and
    adaptability for real-time maritime surveillance.

    Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the
    huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of
    Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g.,
    piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems,
    such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed
    to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the
    fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many
    approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels’ traffic
    behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data.
    These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous
    trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the
    surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions.
    Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel
    kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies,
    irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation. This
    article presents the approaches, constraints, and challenges in maritime
    traffic anomaly detection research, presenting a review, a taxonomy, and a
    discussion of the proposed approaches.

    Abstract This article is a review of publications on maritime cybersecurity
    with the focus made on navigation support. Cyber threats to electronic chart
    display and information system (ECDIS), automatic identification system
    (AIS), voyage data recorder (VDR), and integrated navigation system (INS) as
    a whole are considered. The specific features of cybersecurity of maritime
    autonomous surface ships (MASS) as well as the impact of the human factor on
    cybersecurity are discussed, and the regulatory framework for preventing
    cyber threats is analyzed.

    Le système automatique d’identification (AIS) des navires est un outil
    destiné à accroitre la sécurité de la navigation et l’efficacité de la
    gestion du trafic maritime. Son utilisation renforce à la fois la sécurité
    et la sureté maritime. Ses apports sont indéniables malgré quelques carences
    et limites techniques. Cet article présente les apports et les utilisations
    de la technologie AIS à l’origine d’une importante manne d’informations
    riches pour l’étude et la compréhension des circulations maritimes,
    spécialement pour la communauté scientifique ou les acteurs portuaires. Cet
    état de l’art est réalisé dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre d’une plateforme
    permettant de reconstituer les itinéraires des navires en utilisant les
    signaux AIS.

    This study is an investigation into cyberattacks on autonomous vessels,
    focusing on previous “real-world” cyberattacks and their consequences. The
    future of commercial and noncommercial shipping is moving toward autonomous
    vessels. Autonomous ships can provide significant financial and logistical
    benefits for shipping companies and their stakeholders. However, these
    vessels suffer from shortcomings concerning cybersecurity. Previous
    cyberattacks are investigated to understand how the command system of an
    autonomous ship is infiltrated, the consequences of an attack, and the
    shortfalls of the security of the vessel. This aim is achieved via a
    literature review concerning cyberattacks on autonomous vessels with a focus
    on sources indicating how the security systems of previous vessels were
    breached, the consequence of said cyberattacks, and their capability for
    recovery. Sources used include Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar,
    Mendeley, Zotero, SciFinder, broadsheet, and newspaper articles. The results
    of the literature review showed that autonomous vessels are significantly
    vulnerable to cyberattacks. Autonomous vessels were determined to have
    relatively easy-to-breach security systems. In most cases, the consequences
    of a cyberattack had a negative financial impact, a loss of cargo, and a
    potential breach of oceanic airspace, resulting in military action. The
    vessels analyzed were left “dead in the water” until they were recovered,
    and after a severe attack, the affected shipping company servers suffered
    potential weeklong incapacitation. This study also aims to fill the gaps in
    the transport industry and maritime market concerning the security of
    autonomous vessels and viable recovery procedures.

    This investigation builds upon scholarly research on AI-integrated anomaly
    detection in maritime safety operations from 2014 to 2024. The bibliometric
    analysis analyzes key Countries, Journals, Research themes, Keyword
    frequency, Cocitation analysis, Impactful authors, and significant
    collaborations among researchers and relevant institutes for Maritime
    Anomaly Detection Research. Our findings highlight substantial contributors,
    including China, France, Italy, and the USA, emphasizing essential
    collaboration networks and influential journals such as IEEE Transactions on
    Intelligent Transportation Systems and the International Journal of
    Approximate Reasoning. We scrutinize the application of various AI and
    machine learning models, such as LSTM, CNN, and SVM, across different
    anomaly types. These models are frequently implemented to detect
    environmental, navigation, cybersecurity, sensor, operational,
    communication, and behavioural anomalies. For navigation anomalies like
    unexpected course changes and speed variations, LSTM is utilized due to its
    capability to handle sequential data. CNN is employed for spatial-temporal
    pattern recognition in navigation routes, while SVM is applied to classify
    navigation patterns and detect deviations. Similarly, LSTM effectively
    identifies security anomalies, including unauthorized boardings and
    suspicious activities, through sequence modelling, and CNN proves helpful
    for spatial analysis. This study provides comprehensive insights into the
    current state of maritime anomaly detection research. It proposes future
    research areas, emphasizing model accuracy and efficiency enhancements,
    developing hybrid models, and addressing emerging challenges. Our analysis
    aims to guide researchers and practitioners by identifying critical areas
    for advancement and fostering potential collaborative efforts in this field.

    The rapid technological change in the maritime industry requires a
    consciousness of the impacts and scope of cyber threats and cybersecurity
    risks. This study investigated the relationship between maritime
    cybersecurity risks and threat mitigation measures, comparing developed –
    Spain, and developing – Kenya – IMO member states. Using a case study
    approach with a qualitative research design and focusing on cybersecurity in
    port operations and shipping, the study results showed that the
    cybersecurity strategy implementation in Europe far outpaces that of Africa.
    The study established that the models of cybersecurity measures pursued by
    European and African ports faced an outstanding risk accrued to the slow
    adaptation of cybersecurity strategy, implementation to the rapid change in
    technology and innovation such that these strategies become obsolete before
    optimal use. This is in addition to infrastructure challenges, talent for
    cybersecurity, technology, strategy, governance, crime/fraud, reputation,
    and regulation, among others. The study demonstrated the need for
    cybersecurity to be incorporated into both the European and African maritime
    security apparatuses and frameworks by institutionalizing the responses of
    member states in relation to these types of security risks including raising
    awareness around the vulnerability and cyber threats concerning the maritime
    sphere. The research concludes by stating that, greater effort should be
    focused towards making sure maritime cybersecurity keeps up the with the
    changes in technology. Given the pervasiveness of non-African indication on
    maritime cybersecurity incidents, increased Africa-specific knowledge and
    research is required.

    A global trend in the progressive digitalisation of the world is affecting
    different industries, including the maritime transport sector. Electronic
    navigation and autonomous sailing heavily rely on sensor data, such as
    Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR), Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), or Automated Identification
    System (AIS) systems. Interference with these systems can endanger the
    situational awareness of the ship control system and influence
    navigation-related decisions. Our research focuses on AIS data and seeks
    possible features for anomaly detection based on transmission timing,
    reported and calculated speed analysis. We conducted a comprehensive
    statistical analysis of a 24-hour-long AIS dataset recorded in Tallinn to
    highlight the special characteristics of such data. Our findings suggest
    that the use of a single speed-based feature offers limited benefits,
    leading us to propose the combination of several speed-based features for
    anomaly detection. The results of this research have the potential to impact
    the cyber security of ship’s navigation systems by the identified properties
    of AIS data.

    The automatic identification system (AIS) was introduced in the maritime
    domain to increase the safety of sea traffic. AIS messages are transmitted
    as broadcasts to nearby ships and contain, among others, information about
    the identification, position, speed, and course of the sending vessels. AIS
    can thus serve as a tool to avoid collisions and increase onboard
    situational awareness. In recent years, AIS has been utilized in more and
    more applications since it enables worldwide surveillance of virtually any
    larger vessel and has the potential to greatly support vessel traffic
    services and collision risk assessment. Anomalies in AIS tracks can indicate
    events that are relevant in terms of safety and also security. With a
    plethora of accessible AIS data nowadays, there is a growing need for the
    automatic detection of anomalous AIS data. In this paper, we survey 44
    research articles on anomaly detection of maritime AIS tracks. We identify
    the tackled AIS anomaly types, assess their potential use cases, and closely
    examine the landscape of recent AIS anomaly research as well as their
    limitations.

    Automatic Identification System (AIS) data holds immense research value in
    the maritime industry because of its massive scale and the ability to reveal
    the spatial–temporal variation patterns of vessels. Unfortunately, its
    potential has long been limited by traditional methodologies. The emergence
    of machine learning (ML) offers a promising avenue to unlock the full
    potential of AIS data. In recent years, there has been a growing interest
    among researchers in leveraging ML to analyze and utilize AIS data. This
    paper, therefore, provides a comprehensive review of ML applications using
    AIS data and offers valuable suggestions for future research, such as
    constructing benchmark AIS datasets, exploring more deep learning (DL) and
    deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applications on AIS-based studies, and
    developing large-scale ML models trained by AIS data.

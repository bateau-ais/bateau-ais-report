  abstract = {The swift evolution of digital technologies in maritime operations has highlighted the critical need for tailored cybersecurity measures, especially to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting essential communication protocols such as NMEA 2000. This study introduces an innovative solution based on stochastic semi-Markov processes, specifically tailored to strengthen the cybersecurity framework of maritime IoT systems. By capturing and analyzing the distinct state transitions within maritime networks, the proposed model effectively identifies abnormal activities and promptly alerts operators to potential DDoS attacks, ensuring robust and uninterrupted maritime communications. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, high detection efficiency, and minimal error rates, establishing it as a dependable and specialized approach to protecting critical maritime systems. This research significantly advances maritime cybersecurity by offering proactive and adaptive mechanisms to combat increasingly complex cyber threats.},

This article investigates the pivotal role of these agents in enhancing the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of autonomous maritime systems. Following a structured literature review, we examine the architecture of real-time AI agents, including sensor integration, communication systems, and computational infrastructure. We distinguish maritime AI agents from conventional systems by emphasizing their specialized functions, real-time processing demands, and resilience in dynamic environments. Key safety mechanisms---such as collision avoidance, anomaly detection, emergency coordination, and fail-safe operations---are analyzed to demonstrate how AI agents contribute to operational reliability. The study also explores regulatory compliance, focusing on emission control, real-time monitoring, and data governance. Implementation challenges, including limited onboard computational power, legal and ethical constraints, and interoperability issues, are addressed with practical solutions such as edge AI and modular architectures. Finally, the article outlines future research directions involving smart port integration, scalable AI models, and emerging technologies like federated and explainable AI.

  abstract = {We present a novel method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data. This approach is the first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding \$2+1\$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}3\$, we utilize persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}2\$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions, trajectory data embedded in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ over time do not form loops. Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.},

To achieve the research aim, the article combines primary data from interviews with industry, government and international regulators, a survey completed by practitioners, experts and academics working in the field, and relevant secondary sources. The article makes an original contribution by noting and analysing the approaches of the IMO and the UK government -- bodies which are highly influential in shaping global attitudes, preparation, adoption and responses to such innovative technologies like MASS -- and how they have engaged with the difficult question of regulating the various legal, technical and cybersecurity challenges that they raise. It concludes that for the MASS technology to fulfil its potential and gradually see the integration of such vessels in international shipping in a safe, secure and sustainable way, the international community needs to work together, and update by consensus the key legal instruments and policy documents. In this major task, the UK approach and IOM's leading role can play a protagonist role in developing best practice and implementing respectively.},

  abstract = {The escalating complexity of maritime operations and the integration of advanced radar systems have heightened the susceptibility of maritime infrastructures to sophisticated cyber intrusions. Ensuring resilient and privacy-preserving intrusion detection in such environments necessitates innovative solutions capable of learning from distributed, heterogeneous data sources without compromising sensitive information. This study introduces FED-GEM-CN, a novel federated learning framework designed explicitly for maritime radar intrusion detection. The proposed architecture integrates dual parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) pipelines to independently process network and radar modality features, which are subsequently fused via a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to capture intricate inter-modal dependencies. To enhance feature discriminability, a supervised contrastive learning paradigm is incorporated, while a gradient episodic memory (GEM) buffer strategically retains challenging instances to bolster model robustness against hard-to-detect intrusions. Operating under a federated learning scheme, FED-GEM-CN facilitates collaborative model optimization across distributed radar nodes, preserving data locality and mitigating privacy risks inherent in centralized approaches. Experimental evaluations conducted on a comprehensive real-world maritime radar dataset reveal that FED-GEM-CN achieves superior performance, attaining an overall accuracy exceeding 99~\% and macro F1-scores above 0.97 across federated rounds, with convergence typically observed within 15 communication iterations. These findings substantiate the efficacy of the proposed system in delivering robust, energy-efficient, and privacy-aware intrusion detection tailored to the constraints of maritime radar networks. The approach underscores a significant advancement toward deploying intelligent, distributed cybersecurity solutions within critical maritime infrastructures.},

This study employs a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace (6.3.R1) to identify research trends, highlight key technological advancements, and assess international collaboration. By analyzing publications from major contributors, including the United States, the former Soviet Union, France, and China, the paper reveals technological innovations such as advancements in measurement systems, communication technologies, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced tracking precision. Structural and operational analyses emphasize the importance of design factors, including ship dimensions and internal systems, for ensuring optimal performance in challenging maritime environments. The findings highlight evolving technological priorities and persistent gaps in international collaboration, suggesting opportunities for global partnerships to advance the field.

An emerging risk that demands attention in this context is cybersecurity. The paper examines cybersecurity threats by focusing on the perspective of Arctic SAR operations. A ship may require assistance due to cyberattacks compromising its IT networks or navigation equipment. Attacks could occur through random incidents or intentional actions by cyber criminals who can target vulnerable ships from public databases. The research explores how cyber-attacks could compromise SAR operations, providing detailed threat scenarios by implementing the STAP safe-sec methodology and utilising experts from Arctic rescue operations. The paper highlights areas that need Ships in the Arctic Ocean to be cyber-attack resilient. Cybercriminals could use several pieces of information from public domains to select one or multiple targets when rescue operations would be particularly challenging. The information includes ship equipment failures, wind force, sea state, the number of crew and passengers in distress, and the proximity of nearby ships. A practical scenario demonstrates the methodology's application, focusing on bulk carriers with Polar Code certification. This scenario utilises historical data on weather conditions and ship traffic along the North Sea Route to highlight the practical implications of the research findings.},

  abstract = {Objective: To identify, evaluate and synthesize research published by software engineering researchers concerning their experiences of performing SRs and their proposals for improving the SR process. Method: We undertook a systematic review of papers reporting experiences of undertaking SRs and/or discussing techniques that could be used to improve the SR process. Studies were classified with respect to the stage in the SR process they addressed, whether they related to education or problems faced by novices and whether they proposed the use of textual analysis tools. Results: We identified 68 papers reporting 63 unique studies published in SE conferences and journals between 2005 and mid-2012. The most common criticisms of SRs were that they take a long time, that SE digital libraries are not appropriate for broad literature searches and that assessing the quality of empirical studies of different types is difficult. Conclusion: We recommend removing advice to use structured questions to construct search strings and including advice to use a quasi-gold standard based on a limited manual search to assist the construction of search stings and evaluation of the search process. Textual analysis tools are likely to be useful for inclusion/exclusion decisions and search string construction but require more stringent evaluation. SE researchers would benefit from tools to manage the SR process but existing tools need independent validation. Quality assessment of studies using a variety of empirical methods remains a major problem.},

At the same time, it is increasingly exposed to new types of threats. These include attacks from the cyber and electromagnetic spectrum against various information and telecommunications systems on board vessels as the backbone of the MTS. The radio-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) is one of these systems, used to monitor ship routes and for traffic planning, and supports collision avoidance on the vessel side. The technical vulnerabilities of the system have long been known and caution is therefore advised. Conventional attacks are usually easy to recognize, so that disruptions to operations can occur, but serious damage can be limited. In this paper, however, we present a novel radio-based attack on AIS that enables to selectively suppress identification messages of individual ships and thus to manipulate the situational awareness on the vessel's bridge in a stealthy manner, which can have catastrophic impacts in critical situations. We demonstrate the technical feasibility of this attack in a laboratory environment with real hardware and, by elaborating this vulnerability, we are contributing to increasing the resilience of the maritime domain against evolving hybrid threats.},

  abstract = {The enormous oceans of today are the worldwide arteries of commerce and transportation, making maritime security an issue of fundamental importance. The issue at stake is that conventional approaches of identifying and tracking ships at sea often fail to keep up with the ever-changing conditions of the ocean. These restrictions threaten international commerce, security, and ecological equilibrium by making countries more vulnerable to things like piracy, smuggling, illicit fishing, and pollution. Automatic Identification System (AIS) analytics are strengthened by a range of state-of-theart machine learning and deep learning algorithms in our "Next-Gen Maritime Security" solution. Through the use of these methods, we are able to improve vessel identification, trajectory prediction, behavior grouping, vessel type classification, and anomaly detection. By doing so, we are able to prevent potential threats to maritime security from occurring, therefore protecting international shipping lanes, maritime workers, and marine ecosystems. Our novel strategy provides a solid answer to the problem of marine security in today's dynamic environment.},

  abstract = {This paper uses data processing techniques to reduce the required transmission bandwidth in ship-to-shore communications. The proposed framework (ONline Efficient Sources Transmission Optimizer - ONESTO) leverages state-ofthe-art technologies and novel algorithms to automatically optimize transmissions under structural (e.g., available bandwidth, fixed packet overhead) and user-defined (e.g., maximum latency) constraints. In addition, ONESTO authenticates and encrypts the communication between the ship and the shore via mainstream free and open-source software components. Initially, we present the abstract mathematical formulation of the problem, with its assumptions, goal function, constraints, and significant quantities. Then, we introduce the architecture of a system capable of continuously estimating the compressibility, processing and transmission time of streaming data. Such estimations allow ONESTO to calculate and apply optimal parameters for achieving the best compression ratio. Lastly, using a prototypical implementation, we evaluate the system performance with a Class B ship simulator on two realistic use cases. Our experiments show an excellent compression ratio with maritime protocols (more than 40:1) and a limited latency impact, demonstrating the approach's viability.},

It improves the safety of the maritime traffic and helps to monitor it. However, this system can be manipulated to send falsified information and to mask illicit activities. While previous research has proposed strategies to detect these threats, none of them suggest a solution that considers the time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol. In this work, the compliance of the sent messages with this protocol, specified by the system's standard, is checked for every ship to detect message falsifications. Furthermore, because the ships velocity affects TDMA protocol, a strategy based a Kalman filter is applied to track every ship and to assess the consistency of their velocity data sent. The proposed strategy was validated on real data and showed very promising results. Being computationally cheap, the method can be run in real time. Source codes of the method are open-source to foster research activities from both industry and academia in this field.},

By analyzing peer-reviewed studies and industry reports, this review identifies key AI methodologies, including machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection mechanisms, predictive threat modeling, and AI-enhanced zero-trust architectures. This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques in mitigating cyber risks, explores their implementation challenges, and highlights existing research gaps. The findings indicate that AI-powered solutions significantly enhance real-time threat detection and response capabilities in maritime networks, yet issues such as data scarcity, regulatory constraints, and adversarial attacks on AI models remain unresolved. Future research directions should focus on integrating AI with blockchain, federated learning, and quantum cryptographic techniques to strengthen maritime cybersecurity frameworks.},

However, AIS is vulnerable to GPS spoofing attacks, where malicious actors transmit false GPS signals to mislead vessels about their location. These attacks pose significant risks to maritime safety and security. In this paper, a novel approach to detect spoofed points within vessel trajectory routes using AIS data is proposed. The methodology leverages the power of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, a deep learning architecture adept at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. By analysing AIS data streams, the proposed model identifies anomalies and deviations from expected patterns, effectively pinpointing instances of spoofing. Numerous tests using real-world AIS datasets were carried out, which showed that the suggested Bi-LSTM model outperformed other spoofing detection techniques. The work advances the realm of marine cybersecurity by offering a more reliable and accurate method of AIS spoofing attack detection.},

  abstract = {Maritime transportation plays an essential role in global trade. Due to the huge number of vessels worldwide, there is also a non-negligible volume of Maritime incidents such as collisions/sinking and illegal events (e.g., piracy, smuggling, and unauthorized fishing). Electronic equipment/systems, such as radars and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), have contributed to improving maritime situational awareness. AIS provides one of the fundamental sources of vessel kinematics and static data. Today, many approaches are focused on automatically detecting the vessels' traffic behavior and discovering useful patterns and deviations from those data. These studies contribute to detecting suspicious activities and anomalous trajectories, whose developed techniques could be applied in the surveillance systems, helping the authorities to anticipate proper actions. Several concerns and difficulties are involved in the analyses of vessel kinematics data: how to deal with big data generated, inconsistencies, irregular updates, dynamic data, unlabeled data, and evaluation. This article presents the approaches, constraints, and challenges in maritime traffic anomaly detection research, presenting a review, a taxonomy, and a discussion of the proposed approaches.},

The future of commercial and noncommercial shipping is moving toward autonomous vessels. Autonomous ships can provide significant financial and logistical benefits for shipping companies and their stakeholders. However, these vessels suffer from shortcomings concerning cybersecurity. Previous cyberattacks are investigated to understand how the command system of an autonomous ship is infiltrated, the consequences of an attack, and the shortfalls of the security of the vessel. This aim is achieved via a literature review concerning cyberattacks on autonomous vessels with a focus on sources indicating how the security systems of previous vessels were breached, the consequence of said cyberattacks, and their capability for recovery. Sources used include Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Mendeley, Zotero, SciFinder, broadsheet, and newspaper articles. The results of the literature review showed that autonomous vessels are significantly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Autonomous vessels were determined to have relatively easy-to-breach security systems. In most cases, the consequences of a cyberattack had a negative financial impact, a loss of cargo, and a potential breach of oceanic airspace, resulting in military action. The vessels analyzed were left ``dead in the water'' until they were recovered, and after a severe attack, the affected shipping company servers suffered potential weeklong incapacitation. This study also aims to fill the gaps in the transport industry and maritime market concerning the security of autonomous vessels and viable recovery procedures.},

Our findings highlight substantial contributors, including China, France, Italy, and the USA, emphasizing essential collaboration networks and influential journals such as IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems and the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning. We scrutinize the application of various AI and machine learning models, such as LSTM, CNN, and SVM, across different anomaly types. These models are frequently implemented to detect environmental, navigation, cybersecurity, sensor, operational, communication, and behavioural anomalies. For navigation anomalies like unexpected course changes and speed variations, LSTM is utilized due to its capability to handle sequential data. CNN is employed for spatial-temporal pattern recognition in navigation routes, while SVM is applied to classify navigation patterns and detect deviations. Similarly, LSTM effectively identifies security anomalies, including unauthorized boardings and suspicious activities, through sequence modelling, and CNN proves helpful for spatial analysis. This study provides comprehensive insights into the current state of maritime anomaly detection research. It proposes future research areas, emphasizing model accuracy and efficiency enhancements, developing hybrid models, and addressing emerging challenges.

This study investigated the relationship between maritime cybersecurity risks and threat mitigation measures, comparing developed -- Spain, and developing -- Kenya -- IMO member states. Using a case study approach with a qualitative research design and focusing on cybersecurity in port operations and shipping, the study results showed that the cybersecurity strategy implementation in Europe far outpaces that of Africa. The study established that the models of cybersecurity measures pursued by European and African ports faced an outstanding risk accrued to the slow adaptation of cybersecurity strategy, implementation to the rapid change in technology and innovation such that these strategies become obsolete before optimal use. This is in addition to infrastructure challenges, talent for cybersecurity, technology, strategy, governance, crime/fraud, reputation, and regulation, among others. The study demonstrated the need for cybersecurity to be incorporated into both the European and African maritime security apparatuses and frameworks by institutionalizing the responses of member states in relation to these types of security risks including raising awareness around the vulnerability and cyber threats concerning the maritime sphere. The research concludes by stating that, greater effort should be focused towards making sure maritime cybersecurity keeps up the with the changes in technology.

Interference with these systems can endanger the situational awareness of the ship control system and influence navigation-related decisions. Our research focuses on AIS data and seeks possible features for anomaly detection based on transmission timing, reported and calculated speed analysis. We conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of a 24-hour-long AIS dataset recorded in Tallinn to highlight the special characteristics of such data. Our findings suggest that the use of a single speed-based feature offers limited benefits, leading us to propose the combination of several speed-based features for anomaly detection.

In recent years, AIS has been utilized in more and more applications since it enables worldwide surveillance of virtually any larger vessel and has the potential to greatly support vessel traffic services and collision risk assessment. Anomalies in AIS tracks can indicate events that are relevant in terms of safety and also security. With a plethora of accessible AIS data nowadays, there is a growing need for the automatic detection of anomalous AIS data.
